## Introduction

PolarisATC was created to address the main limitations found in IVAO Aurora and similar radar clients. While Aurora is a powerful tool, it restricts users in several key areas, such as integration with third-party applications, sector file customization, and overall flexibility.

### PolarisATC has:
- **Full Freedom for 3rd Party Integration:** Easily connect with external tools and plugins, enabling a more complete and customizable ATC environment.
- **Customizable Sector Files:** Load, edit, and create sector files without the limitations imposed by other platforms.
- **Bug Reduction and Stability:** Designed from the ground up to minimize bugs and provide a more stable experience.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Built to be resource-efficient, ensuring smooth performance even on less powerful hardware.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Modern, intuitive, and accessible UI for both beginners and experienced controllers.
- **Open Source and Community-Driven:** Anyone can contribute, suggest features, or adapt the software to their needs.

PolarisATC is cross-platform, lightweight, and open source, making it ideal for both training and recreational use.

In summary, PolarisATC is not just an alternative to Auroraâ€”it's a next-generation ATC radar client designed to empower users with more control, flexibility, and reliability.
